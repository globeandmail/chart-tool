# Chart Tool

Chart Tool is a platform for creating, storing and displaying beautiful, responsive embeddable charts. Designed to fit the needs of a fast-paced mobile and print newsroom, Chart Tool generates charts in several formats:

* **SVGs** that are both responsive and interactive, via an embed code
* **PDFs** that can be almost immediately dropped into a print content management system
* **JPGs and PNGs** for use as thumbnails and sharing on social media

## How it works

Chart Tool is made up of two parts:

**A back end interface** for storing data, creating and exporting charts, and generating a static embed code, powered by [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). Embed codes are static by design — if your back end goes down, all the charts on your site will still display properly. [Try out a demo of the charts interface](https://chart-tool-demo.herokuapp.com/).


**A front-end JavaScript and CSS library** that parses embed codes generated by the back end and renders a responsive chart on your website using parts of [D3.js](http://d3js.org). The front-end library also offers [an API](https://github.com/globeandmail/chart-tool/blob/master/tutorials/api.md) that can be accessed to modify charts before or after they've been drawn. [Check out some example charts on our website](http://globeandmail.github.io/chart-tool).


## Features

* **Searchable database:** All charts are stored in a searchable, taggable database for easy retrieval
* **Simple, straightforward GUI:** Easy-to-use (and easy-to-teach!) collaborative interface for editing charts, so multiple people can work on the same chart at once
* **Asset generation:** Easily generate PNGs at any size for use on social media, or PDFs for print use
* **Fallback images:** All charts come with a fallback image in case the library is unable to draw the chart. Fallbacks can be stored on AWS, or bundled as inline Base64 images
* **Fully responsive:** Charts will redraw automatically on window resize
* **Lots of chart types:**
  * Line charts
  * Area charts
  * Stacked area charts
  * Column charts
  * Stacked column charts
  * Bar charts
  * Stacked bar charts
  * Multiline charts
  * Scatterplots
  * No pies [(sorry)](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2011/07/death-to-pie-charts)
* **Annotations:** All charts can be annotated with text annotations, pointer arrows, highlighting a range along the x- or y-axis, or highlighting a bar or column.
* **Highly configurable:** Don't want tips to appear for a specific chart, or want to manually set the number of ticks to be displayed? No problem!
* **"Ordinal-time" scales:** Treat time series data as if it were ordinal — this is very useful for visualizing stock price charts, or when you want to skip weekends and holidays
* **Pre- and post-render hooks:** All charts come with several basic custom events via D3's [dispatch library](https://github.com/d3/d3-dispatch), including pre- and post-render hooks for every chart
* **Zero external dependencies:** The Chart Tool library comes bundled with everything it'll need right out of the box
* **Lightweight libraries:** The front-end CSS and JS libraries clock in at a combined **61.9 kB** minified and gzipped


## Examples and demo

Examples of the types of charts Chart Tool can generate can be found [here](http://globeandmail.github.io/chart-tool).

For a demo of the back end interface used to generate charts, images and PDFs, check out our [demo app](https://chart-tool-demo.herokuapp.com/).


## Getting started

Chart Tool is designed to work with Docker, a popular virtualization platform that simplifies development and deployment. If using Docker, you won't have to install any of the project's dependencies.

You'll need both Docker and docker-compose for this project. To install them, follow the [instructions here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). You may want to [increase your docker-machine memory size](https://gist.github.com/scotthaleen/f7ba55ca3cedd4a8097f2f139177ddc7) to 2048mb or 4096mb if you can afford it.

Once that's done, clone the Chart Tool repo to your computer.

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:globeandmail/chart-tool.git && cd chart-tool
```

You can now set up the Chart Tool in either development mode — useful for tweaking styles and exploring the tool — or production mode, which is ready to be deployed to a Linux server.

To run Chart Tool in deployment mode, you'll need to build the image (this may take up to 10 minutes the first time as Docker downloads and sets up the virtual environment):

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build
```

After that, you can stand up the server by running:

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

That's it! You're running your own development copy of Chart Tool!  :tada: :tada: :tada:

If you'd like to work on the front-end interface, the command is slightly different:

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml run --service-ports app npm run serve
```

## Tutorials

Now that you've got Chart Tool up and running, here are some tips on how to get rolling.

For starters, you might want to read up on how to make your first chart. A full tutorial, including how to embed it on the web or generate a static image at multiple sizes is [available here](https://github.com/globeandmail/chart-tool/blob/master/tutorials/first-chart.md).
